CLI now supports creating themes with 1 or more "main" colors, a neutral color, and 1 or more "support" colors. The "main" and "support" colors can have arbitrary names. There can not be more than 4 colors of each category unless you're using Figma on the Enterprise plan, due to plan-based restrictions on the number of variable modes per collection.
