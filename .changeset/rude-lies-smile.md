React components and css now support custom colors through the `data-color` attribute.

**BREAKING CHANGE**: All React components that had a `color` prop have been changed to use `data-color`.

All<sup>1</sup> css targeting `data-color` has been changed to work with all custom colors generated by the CLI.

`Avatar`, `Badge`, `Button`, and `Link` use `--ds-color-accent-*`<sup>2</sup>, unless `data-color` is set directly on the element.

For components that had a `color` prop, but defaulted to something other than `"accent"`, `data-color` must also be set directly on the element.

All other components that defaulted to `"accent"`, or previously only existed in `"accent"` color, now support `data-color`. They will also inherit their color from the closest `data-color` attribute. If none is found, they use `--ds-color-accent-*`<sup>2</sup>.

<sup>1</sup>: ...except `Alert`, which only supports `info`, `warning`, `danger` and `success` colors.  
<sup>2</sup>: If an `"accent"` color is not defined in the theme, the `--ds-color-accent-*` variables will point to the first `main-color`.
