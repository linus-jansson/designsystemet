## I Want To Contribute

### Getting involved with development

It's fantastic that you want to join in and help with our development efforts!
We have established two contribution levels to suit task size: the first level for smaller tasks and the second for larger ones. The main difference is how involved you will be with the Design System Team.

Unsure which level to choose? Send us an email at <designsystem@digdir.no> and we will get back to you as soon as we can!
You can also join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/designsystemet/shared_invite/zt-2438eotl3-a4266Vd2IeqMWO8TBw5PrQ) and ask questions there.

We suggest creating a draft pull request as soon as you start working on something. This ensures that different people aren't working on the same task.

Before you start coding also take a look at [how to get started with development](#getting-started-with-development) and our [coding standards](#how-to-write-and-structure-your-code).

#### Addressing minor bugs and handling smaller feature requests

Spotted a bug you would like to help fix? Easy! Just fork this repository and submit a [pull request](#pull-requests).
A person from the design system team will follow up from there.

Do the same for smaller feature requests. We cannot guarantee that the new feature will be implemented, but we will try our best to make it happen!

#### Developing new components and handling larger tasks

Your team needs a new component that doesn't exist in the the design system and want to help develop it?
Great news! We have created a process to handle just this use case!

1. Submit a [feature request](https://github.com/digdir/designsystemet/issues/new/choose) detailing your requirements, and indicate your interest in contributing to the development of this component.
2. The design system team will review the feature request and assess its compatibility with the design system.
3. If the component fits within the scope of the design system we will follow you up from there.

Developing components for the design system requires that developers are closely connected to the design system team. We will invite you to participate in our daily check-ins throughout the development process to ensure that the component adheres to our coding standards and seamlessly integrates with our design system.

### Getting started with development

Follow these steps to get up and running with Storybook or Storefront (designsystemet.no).

Run the commands from the root of your project. Make sure you clone the `next` branch, this is where we do development.

`yarn`
`yarn build`

#### 4. Start local development servers

`yarn storybook | storefront`

You can now start developing for storybook and the storefront.

#### Building using docker

`docker build -t <app> -f .\CI\Dockerfile --build-arg APP_NAME=<app> .`

`docker run -p <PORT>:3000 designsystemet/<app>@latest`

### Pull requests

When creating a pull request for the design system, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- When you create your pull request for the first time make sure to mark it as a [draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). This is mainly to prevent unnecessary notifications for reviewers during the development process. If you forget then no problem!
- We utilize automated code checks to verify that pull requests align with our established standards. These checks must be successful for the pull request to be merged into the main branch. You don't need to worry about this during development.
  - The pull request title must adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.
  - We run linting and formatting checks on all the code.
- When you are done with development you can mark the pull request as ready for review by clicking on the button at the bottom. A person from the design system team will then review your code and comment if there are things that need to be changed. Once the pull request is approved it will be merged into the main branch.
- Make sure the PR is pointing to the `next` branch.

## Styleguides

### Commit Messages

This project uses Changesets with the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification in order to generate changelogs.

The [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) specification is used for versioning.

To include commits in the changelog, please ensure that you include the following keywords:

- Start the commit with `fix:` to trigger a patch (0.0.x) version.
- Start the commit with `feat:` to trigger a minor (0.x.0) version.

#### Scope

To make commit messages and the changelog more specific and readable, you have the option to scope your commits by adding a keyword in parentheses that indicates the area or aspect you are working on. This practice helps provide clearer context and organization to the commit history.

##### Examples:

- Adding a new component: `feat(Button): added a new Button component`.
- Adding documentation for icons: `docs(icons): added new documentation for the icons package`.

#### When to use what keywords

It is crucial to understand the distinctions between the two sections mentioned below. If you wish for commit messages to be included in the changelog, please use `fix:` or `feat:` as keywords. These keywords indicate changes that impact the users of our NPM packages and are therefore significant to highlight. For any other types of changes that do not directly affect the end user, please utilize a different keyword. If you are uncertain about which keyword to use and the changes are non-user-facing, you can use `chore:` as a default keyword.
